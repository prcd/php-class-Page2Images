# php-page2images-class

A PHP class for the page2images API (free account required at http://www.page2images.com)

I recently had a project where I needed screenshots of HTML templates I was generating programatically. After a bit of searching I found page2images.com who offer a free service with an API, callback and no watermarks. They provide some sample code which got me started but I decided to write a class to make the whole process smoother. 

Upload this folder and its contents to a server and try out the files in the example folder. The example files have explanation comments in them and can be set up in seconds.
